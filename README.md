# Bioinformatics

Welcome to the bioinformatics project! This repository contains a collection of implementations of widely used algorithms in the field of bioinformatics. Bioinformatics is a discipline that combines biology, computer science, and mathematics to analyze and understand biological data, such as DNA sequences, proteins, and other biological elements.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to provide a collection of essential algorithms in bioinformatics that help researchers and professionals efficiently and accurately analyze and manipulate biological data. Each algorithm will be implemented in a specific programming language and will be properly documented to facilitate its understanding and usage.

## Included Algorithms

The repository will contain a variety of algorithms spanning different areas of bioinformatics. Some of the algorithms you can find are:

1. **Sequence Alignment Algorithms:** Including global alignment, local alignment, heuristic search algorithms such as blast, and multiple sequence alignment.

2. **Pattern Search Algorithms:** To find specific sequences within larger datasets, such as the subsequence search algorithm.

3. **Genome Assembly Algorithms:** To reconstruct genomic sequences from fragments.

4. **Protein Structure Prediction Algorithms:** To predict the three-dimensional structure of proteins from their amino acid sequence.

5. **Classification and Clustering Algorithms:** To cluster related sequences or proteins into families.

6. **Gene Expression Analysis Algorithms:** To analyze and visualize gene expression data.

## Repository Structure

The repository will be organized as follows:

```
/
|-- algorithm_1/
|   |-- code.py
|   |-- README.md
|
|-- algorithm_2/
|   |-- code.py
|   |-- README.md
|
|-- ...
|
|-- README.md
```

Each algorithm will have its own directory, which will contain the source code implemented in the corresponding programming language (e.g., Python, Java, C++, etc.) and a `README.md` file that will provide a detailed explanation of the algorithm, its functioning, complexity, and any other relevant information.
